Team repo into your personal Github repo is to create a new repo on your personal site, give it any name you want, including the same name; when you do that, Github will give you the full URL as a link you can copy.  Then add that link as a remote by going `git remote add personal <paste link here>`; then you can go `git push personal <branch name>` and you will have the project up on Github; I will add that to the Readme now.
