<!-- What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? -->
It iwas a way to build user interfaces with reusable components that result in faster loading times and less bugs.
<!-- What does it mean to think in react? -->
It means to break things down into components
<!-- Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. -->
Functional components are just JavaScript functions. They take in an optional input which, as I've mentioned earlier, is what we call props.
Class components offer more features, and with more features comes more baggage. The primary reason to choose class components over functional components is that they can have state.
<!-- Describe state. -->
State is an objet that determines how that component renders and behaves
<!-- Describe props. -->
Props are custom parameters for components
