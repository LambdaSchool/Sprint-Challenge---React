1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a    Functional/Presentational component.
    React let you define component as class or function . Component defined as a function only have props available that can passed down to children components and they are limited in terms of functionality and they are called stateless ,because they don't have that abiliy for their property to be manipulated .
    meanwhile a stateful component used base javascript class to give the component more functionality like the state function in order to manipulate the props and render data dynamic upon changes of the said data.

1.  Describe state.
    state is the heart of the react component , state dictate how the component behave and render, whith state you can create dynamic component that's respond to change and render new UI when that happen.State is internal to a component.

1.  Describe props.
    Props are short of properties , props is how data is passed down from a parent component to a child component , allowing the child component to act upon recieving this props , pros are immutable , The idea behind props is that you can make a single component that is used in many different places in your app.
