{/*What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React is a Java Script Library, that uses individual components to create complex UIs. Beacsue it is designed to only re-render that which is changed, that makes it "reactive".

What does it mean to think in react?
    To think in react is to break things down in to possible components, a component that serves only one function idealy.
Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A functional component is literally a java script function, it accepts a single property object as an argument and returns a React element. Class components have more features (such as the use of state), but they both can do the same thing.
Describe state.
    State is the data we have available in our application. We can create data, update data, and read data using state.

Describe props.
     properties are to React components what attributes are to HTML elements. Properties are the relationship between an object key and its value.*/}
