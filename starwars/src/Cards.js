// Your goal here is to build an app that 
// displays the data provided in whatever way 
// you see fit!

// Don't worry about the fields whose values 
// are URLs. You'll figure out what to do with
// data like that later on in the course. 
// For now, just build a react app that displays 
// this fun Star Wars data. Build a card for each 
// object and style it to make it nice and fancy.
