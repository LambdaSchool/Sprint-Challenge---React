What is React JS? What types of problems does it solve?

React is a library for building user-interfaces.  Apps have the potential to have millions of people interact with them and change their 'state'.  React, by using a virtual DOM, is able to build many different components, create powerful apps, and update them in an efficient amount of steps, which helps not to overload the DOM and provide a smooth experience for users and developers.
