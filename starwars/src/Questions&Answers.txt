1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other Javascript Frameworks?
    -React JS is a library from Javascript that helps with user interfaces.
    -It is extremely handy when it comes to Front-end Development and is efficient
     in writing DOM in js.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. 
   Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
    -React Component Lifecycle allows the user to do certain actions when a component is created or destroyed.
        a. constructor(): This initializes the state and is often used to bind event handlers to the class instance.
        b. componentWillReceiveProps(): This updates the state once a new prop is inputted. 
        c. componentWillUnmount(): This method is called right before a method is destroyed.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component 
   and a Functional/Presentational component.
    -Class Component: Are only passed through the file. They get passed as an attribute/context.
    vs.
    -State Component: They can be set using this.state. They can get rendered more than once and can update the 'state' of the application.

    -Functional component: They focus on how things work and the behavior of components. Specifies how 
        data should be loaded.
    vs.
    -Presentational component: Focuses on the 'image' and how it looks. Can be adjusted without altering or 
        touching the data. (Containers)

4. Name the three arguments that are passed into the React.createElement() function?
    -The three arguments passed into React.createElement() are types, props, and children.
        a. types:  HTML element/React component
        b. props:  an object containing properties and values, can also be null
        c. children: string that get converted to text, an instance of React.createClass() & React.createElement()
