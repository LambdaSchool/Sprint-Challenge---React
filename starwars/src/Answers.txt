//1.What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    // It helps on developers by giving them tools to make more dynamic
    // and reusable components and makes the data flow within the whole app more
    // transparent


//2.What does it mean to think in react?
    // Thinking in react is working with the state and just passing
    // down the data through props with components.

// 3.Briefly describe some of the differences
//   between a Class/Stateful component and a 
//   Functional/Presentational component.

// Class/Stateful Components are meant to hold data for the components and manage the state.
//While Functional/Presentational components are meant to show the data
//  and get the data as props from the state

//4. Describe state.
// State is a object on our components that holds data later on to be managed and displayed.

// 5.Describe props.
// Props are datasets in react used to access data in the state by
// Key-value pair in the components to make it dynamic and reusable.
