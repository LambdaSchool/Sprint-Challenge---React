1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a JavaScript library developed to build scalable applications that need to change data frequently without reloading the entire page. It is also super useful for building reusable UI components.


1. What does it mean to think in react?
I take it to mean thinking about your App in components and how they will interact with eachother.

1. Describe state.
It is the particular 'state' of something. The State Object is where you store values that belong to a component.

1. Describe props.

Props are passed to different components to pass around state or functions that manipulate state.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Anything that can be observed when an operation is completed BESIDES the return value of the operation.

You employ useEffect to ensure the only thing that changes is what was intended.
