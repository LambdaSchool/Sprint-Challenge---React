1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?
    It's a framework, is all I've got. I have no idea how it's different form other frame works.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
    componentWillMount(): 
    componentDidMount():
    render():

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a `Class/Stateful component` and a `Functional/Presentational component`.
    Class: The purpose is to hold on to some data knowing that it is dynamice and will continue to change.

    Function: The purpose of this is to have data passed to it, and then render the data.

4. Name the three arguments that are passed into the `React.createElement()` function?
    I have no idea what this is. 
    I'm going to assume that it's going to be:
    constructor()
    super()
    this.state


    This is all that I got out of the last couple lectures on React and I'm really disappointed by this. I truly believe that my time would have been better spent not listening to the lectures or attempting the assignments and doing my own research. This week has been an absolute bust. I am not going to even attempt this sprint becasue I have no idea what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it.
