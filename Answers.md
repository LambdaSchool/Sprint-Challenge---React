1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

`A stateful component is a React object that defines state, typically inheriting the React.Component class. With a stateful component you are able to modify the presentation layer/data on a user action.`

`A functional/presentation object is ideally a stateless object. Using those objects you can modify items, but not the state of the presentation UI`

1.  Describe state.

`state - is a property within an object that ideally defines what state the UI is in and what is it presenting. state can be passed on to child objects as props.`

1.  Describe props.

`props are properties of the virtual DOM that are inherited when using React.Component. state is one such prop. You can create additional props just like you can in any class and pass props/objects to virtual DOM props.`
