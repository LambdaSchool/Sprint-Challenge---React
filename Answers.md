1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React JS is a javascript framework that streamlines the use of the DOM element by implementing a 
virtual DOM. This is capable of only refreshing elements that change rather than the whole page. 
It also does this live. It may be different because it is not oppinionated, meaning you can use
other frameworks with it. 

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
React component lifecycle is an order of operations that dictates what lifecycle methods
occur first when initializing and updating a React project. 

Constructor() Allows us to create state. 
ComponenentWillMount() Called if and only if the component and all of it's sub-components rendered properly
Render() Allows updates to DOM elements that change 


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional components are just javascript functions.
Class components allow you to create a constructor that sets state.
