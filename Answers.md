1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

It's a JS library that allows you to write code in a different syntax. It makes creating "components" more easy, and provides an efficient way to pass information between those components.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I don't... honestly know what this question is getting at. I guess, to consider things in terms of components and props and state?

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A class/state component is where actual original data is being stored, functional components then access that data and manipulate/display it.

1.  Describe state.

State, as I understand it, is where particular information lives, unchanging. It can be referred to, and passed around with props. If you want to change it, you can copy it, tweak the copy, and replace the original with the copy, or something along those lines. Maybe there are other ways that I missed. 

1.  Describe props.

Props allow for a cascade of data. They can pass original inputs into different components and ultimately whatever is rendered.
