1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
Through lifecycle methods, we can then control what happens when each tiny section of your UI renders, updates, thinks about re-rendering, and then disappears entirely.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
