1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React is a JS library. It allows for easier creation of user interfaces that only rerender specific components of an app when data, or state, changes rather than rerendering eveything.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Thinking in react involves breaking your project down into components that make sense. Looking at the problem in logical pieces rather than a whole. Then building the project up from the components to a static version, followed by adding functionality.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    Components that are stateful have the ability of being changed and make changes to other components based on data changes made by the user or another component. Functional components do not handle changes in state but can be effected by changes in state.

4.  Describe state.
    State is the data that is inputed and manipulated through the user interface. The current status of the state typically controls what is rendered by the app.

5.  Describe props.
    Props are properties that are passed on to child components, typically pieces of information from the state.
