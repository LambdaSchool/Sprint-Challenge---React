1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?
- React is a JavaScript library that allows you to create custom/reusable DOM elements. This makes it different from other libraries begcause React is more front-end (HTML(using JSX), CSS) while other libraries are more back-end (routing, data layer, etc).

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
- These are just phases through which the React component goes (initial phase when it's created, updates when state or props change, and unmounting when it's removed).
 #1 getInitialState() sets the initial value (accesible via this.state)
 #2 render() returns the markup
 #3 componentDidUpdate() performs operations after the data has been updated.


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
- hmm...
