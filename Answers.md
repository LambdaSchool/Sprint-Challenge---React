1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is a framework that exists between the code and the DOM. It tries to optimize the browser side by creating 
a virtual DOM to compare changes made to the original and then render only those changes only to the DOM. It means you 
can have more data on a page reloading in real time without bogging down the speed of the page.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
I don't know... perhaps to consider the break down of the page into components and what needs to be reuseable. 

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
The way I understand it is you write functional components until you need something to have it's own state. If 
it needs to hold it's own data, then it needs to be in a class component.

1.  Describe state.
state is just data stored in the class component to be passed into functional components.

1.  Describe props.
props is a place holder in a functional component that takes in the data.
