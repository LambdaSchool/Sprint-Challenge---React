1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

	-React is a framework that tries to better manage and deal with
	live rendering and updateing. I've often thought a good way to
	think about it at first is, Less => CSS, as React => JavaScript

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

	-Thinking about your problem(building an app) in react before and as
	your writing code. Keeping in mind how react works and flows

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

	-Stateful components interpret live rendering.
	-Functional components are "fixed" definitions

1.  Describe state.
	-State is the "ether" or "void" of live rendering. Any changed made while
	the applicaiton is running are updating as quickly as possible

1.  Describe props.
	-"Read only" or better described as once it's written and used. That's how it is.
	That function won't change or mutate because it's static. V.S. stateful components
	which can mutate
