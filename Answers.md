1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    ReactJS is a library that allows one to think of a site/ or app in components versus using vanilla JS and just HTML/CSS which makes us create multiple changes. React renders everything in one page, usually App.js and makes it more efficient as it is run on the browser and not a server.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    View your design in reusable components

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    Class components are where methods, and state should live so as to keep the confusion down by having one main component and use the others to pass state to the main class.

1.  Describe state.
    State is where an app can render changes we want on the page, and is not to be mutated directly, it must be done with setState without mutating the original data

1)  Describe props.
    Like constructor functions having properties, props are just properties on components that we can make for each one.
