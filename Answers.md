2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    Think in React is understanding that React is a collection of components which can be broken down into smaller components in a hierarchical order. All together, these pieces makeup a single applicaton entity.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    Class components are used when state is needed and/or the ability to change state in that component. Functional Components are used to return presentational components to the DOM and add structure to the app.

4.  Describe state.

    State is a default value which changes as a user interacts with it. State helps keep track of information in between any renders that it does. When a component needs to keep track of information between renderings then the component itself can create, update, and use state.

5.  Describe props.

    Props are short for properties. they are passed into components in a similia manner that arguments are passed into -- functions but can also there by default if none are passed.
