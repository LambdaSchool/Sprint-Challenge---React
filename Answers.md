## Questions
1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?
..* React is a what to write javascript expressions and html together as components.  It allows for states to be kept in classes and pass the state to children as props.  It renders the components into html.
2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
..* (fuzzy on this) A lifecycle is basically the moment a component is rendered and a hook is implemented to update the component in some way.
..* componentDidMount: 
..* componentWillReceiveProps:   
..* shouldComponentUpdate:
..* After spending 30 minutes or so reading about this, I still really have no idea how these are useful/necessary/implemented... Hopefully this will be covered extensively next week, because it was talked about for maybe an hour at best this week.
3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a `Class/Stateful component` and a `Functional/Presentational component`.
..* A class component has a state.
..* A functional component takes in props.
..* I am sure there is more of a difference between them, but up to this point that is what I've understood to be the defining difference.
