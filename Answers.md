1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a JavaScript library that allows the user to create rich interfaces
involving lots of data, while simplifying and abstracting out some of the more
onerous aspects of DOM manipulation. It allows for efficient handling of data
and DRYer code with reusable components that can easily access said data.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react means thinking in terms of components (class and functional
types), and also in terms of data state, and props. Tie all that together
using the JSX syntax to efficiently build out interfaces that present data
to the user dynamically.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4.  Describe state.

5.  Describe props.
