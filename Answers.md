## Answers

1. React JS is an unopinionated JavaScript front-end library that excels at rendering user interfaces.  The problems it solves focus on applications in which large amounts of data interact with the user interface causing the need for it to selectively update, refresh, or in essence go from a static set of information to the "live-feed" we have become so accustomed to today.  Additionally, React is a good library choice for applications that can be compartmentalized into single functional units that either store and update data, manipulate data, or render data to create a user interface.  The best example to use in order to get a clear picture of where React excels would be FaceBook.  In fact, Facebook developers actually created React to handle and increase the efficiency of the types of interactions and data manipulations seen there.  In fact, it's quite amazing in reality, considering that only a decade ago updating and rendering certain parts of the DOM in real time without a full page reload and the concept of something like a live feed in Web 1.0 just didn't exist or existed as easily as it does today.
