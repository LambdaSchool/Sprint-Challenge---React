1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React JS is a framework to help create interactive UIs.  It differs from other frameworks because it breaks sites down into very small, reusable components.  

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4.  Briefly describe PropTypes and what we use them for when building react applications.
PropTypes defines what sort of data you were expecting to be coming in.  You can make a certain PropType required for your site to make sure that incomming data of the wrong type won't breake your site.
