* READ THIS FIRST *
** I did not google any of this. If these sprint challenges are designed to gauge how I am grasping the topic, then you need to know that I really don't know that much more about React now than I did Monday. I wanted to give you an accurate picture of where I'm at with this. **

* I have now added answers because I was told to google *


* What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks? * 
**  I have no idea, really. **
*** a library for handling front end interfaces, to make things modular rather than long swathes of html and css. Differs from other frameworks in that it's only for front end, no back end stuff. And it makes reusable components. ***

* Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do. *
** Initialize - Mount - Render - Unmount **
** I am pretty vague on this, but Initialize is creating the app, Mounting is putting all the components in the app, Render is ????, and Unmount, I guess, is removing things? I'm not really sure. **
*** Okay it's apparently Mounting, Updating, Unmounting, Error handling. (I think I was close) Mounting preps/stages the stuff you want to happen on your page. Render makes it happen. Unmounting I'm still not sure but I believe it's checking to make sure everything worked right. And if it didn't work right, then we move into Error Handling which is (dun da daaaa) where we deal with errors. ***

* Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. *
** Class/Stateful components are changeable and are better for more complex components, functional are not changeable and are for the simpler components of your app. **
*** Also, functional doesn't manipulate the DOM, just renders JSX to the root. Performs the same every time it's called. Class components do all the stuff functional components don't. Mutable, flexible, manipulates the DOM, needs props.***

* Name the three arguments that are passed into the React.createElement() function? *
** Nope, sorry. I have no idea. **
*** Type, Props, Children. ***
