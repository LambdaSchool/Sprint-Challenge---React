1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks? 
> React JS is a JavaScript framework that is designed for building user interfaces.  Instead of making changes to the actual DOM and or reloading entire web pages. React allows you to build specific components whose state can be dynamically set through a virtual DOM.  This makes it much faster than other JavaScript frameworks.  The fact that it is designed to be broken into components makes it easier to debug. React also is deployable as an application either on the web or on either iOS or Android devices. React uses JSX which is a JavaScript based markup language, which makes it easy to compose your compnent all together in one place.
2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
> As a compnent is rendered or re-rendered through the setState method, React has a built in way to listen for these Lifecycle events. For example: 
> 1. `componentDidMount()` method is a hook that runs after the component output has finished rendering.
> 2. `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` method is a hook that is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being recieved. 
> 3. `componentDidCatch(error, info)` is a method used for catching errors of children and rendering a default UI instead of the crashed interface.
3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a `Class/Stateful component` and a `Functional/Presentational component`.
> A stateful component obviously has an object called state, whereas a functional component gets passed an object called props as its parameter. Stateful components are more self-contained. State is defined and or changed internally, whereas props can be passed to a functional component externally. If a Component needs to alter one of its attributes at some point in time, that attribute should be part of its state.  On the other hand, a component cannot change its own props.  A functional component simply just renders something - it's "dumb".
