1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library that contains built in objects and methods which can be used to create more dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in React means breaking down the different components of your UI and thinking about the different ways that data could be stored, changed, and passed to each component.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Class/Stateful component can store data in state, which is an object that exists on the Class component. As state changes, the Class component invokes the render function, which can result in the reactivity and responsiveness associated with React.

A functional component is written in the style of a traditional Javascript function and is used to represent elements on a page. Functional components use props as their data, which can inherit their values from the state of a Class component.

1.  Describe state.

State is an object that exists on a class component. Changes to state cause the render function to be invoked on a class component, which could lead to changes in the ways that elements are rendered on the DOM.

1.  Describe props.

Props are stored in functional components. They're useful in that they can receive data from state and allow for differences in individual elements that serve a common purpose. Props allow for reusability and repeatability in functional components.
