1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
ReactJS is a UI library which allows developers to build and scale applications. It allows developers to build components which can be reused an unlimited number of times allowing for scaling quickly. All of this is accomplished through the DOM and ReactJS' own virtual DOM which reduces the amount that the actual DOM has to process, increasing application speed.
