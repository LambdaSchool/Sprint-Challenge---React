1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

There are many difference between class and functional components. One is the syntax that is used to write them. Functional components are written as just regular JS functions but class components requires you to extend from the React.Component. With that being said once you have extended from the React.Component that new class that is created now has access to 'state' and also all of the methods that are provided on the React.Comoponent class.
With class components you also have access to lifecycle hooks provided from the React.Comonent.
