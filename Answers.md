1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try to solve?

`React is a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces. React is distinguished by its use of a “virtual DOM”, a cached version of the DOM that computes all changes before updating. React’s component-based, modular approach makes it easier to refactor than a vanilla JS app.`

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

`Thinking in React means thinking in terms of components (limbs), props (aspects of those limbs), and state (the brain that controls it all).`

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

`Functional components may send and receive data, but unlike a Class component, they do not store data.`

1.  Describe state.

`State is data storage within a component. State is updated by calling `this.setState`.`

1.  Describe props.

`Props are functions and/or variables passed to a child component, which that child component may use.`
