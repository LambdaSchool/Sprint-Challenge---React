1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React JS is a library for building UI with reusable components. React helps to manage moving data in a way that is less cumbersome than just using vanilla JS. It also lets you write JS using HTML syntax.
1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Thinking in react means knowing how to break down an app into different components.
1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A functional component does not have state and can only render DOM elements. A class component has a state that changes as users interact with it. 
1.  Describe state.
    State is a unique property on a Class component. When state exits, data can be passed from the parent component to the child component as props.
1.  Describe props.
    Props are like attributes in that they are information that is passed from one component to another.
