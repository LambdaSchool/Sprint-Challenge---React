1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    - React JS is a library for building user interfaces. One of the best thing that React does is reduce the massive amount of data that’s being rendered by the DOM and it reduces it by only changing certain parts of an application that needs to be updated instead of reloading the whole app that DOM is doing.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    - It means that before you start building your app using React is to think of the process first of how you’ll be building your components.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    - Functional/Presentational components are components that only takes care of how should your app will look like while Class/Stateful components are components that manages the state(or data) of your application.

4.  Describe state.
    - State is the data that we’re passing around and using in a class component and we can only update it using `this.setState()`.

    - Props is an object that can be passed to a functional component as an argument/parameter and can be used to add properties or custom attributes to the React elements that a functional component is returning.
