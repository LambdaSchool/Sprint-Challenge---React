1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a JS framework used to build interfaces. The strengths of this framework are in its ability to scale easily, and your ability to reuse components, keeping your code DRY. Also, because of how React is designed with the virtual DOM, it solves one of the big problems with writing in other frameworks: the virtual DOM helps to render changes to the DOM faster, because it only updates elements that have changed, instead of reloading everything.
1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in the structure: How do I setup my program to best use react's class and component architecture, for reusability, etc.

state is where the data is held

1.  Describe props.

props is short for properties...props are like variables that help to communicate state info to the presentational components.
