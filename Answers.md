1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? 
    --Commits
        ReactJS is a UI library that allows the developer to create powerful, complex applications. Currently, modern applications and websites are interactive, complicated and always changing; react solves this problem by allowing developers the tools to provide a smoother experience for the user. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
        To think in react means to think of creating applications with small reusable chunks of code called components.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
        Functional/Presentational components are simpler and have less functionality than class components and can be passed props. However, Functional/Presentational components don't have states. Class/stateful components have access to state and life cycle methods (and methods more generally can be used with classes).

4.  Describe state.
        When describing class components, state describes the part of the application that can handle changes.

5.  Describe props.
        When describing components, props are data that can be passed into a component that allow for application communitcation. This data can then be passed from parent to child and is immutable.
