1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    ReactJS is a Javascript library that is created and managed by Facebook. It aims to ease the process of creating
    complex UI/UX with reusable components.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    To be able to plan ahead and know when to use components vs not as well as knowing what kind of component to use is
    at the core of thinking in react.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    Class, or stateful, components are components that use state to hold and manage data. This data is often render to the
    screen for the user to see. It is built off of ES6 classes and extend React.component

    Presentational, or functional, components are built as a function that is used solely for rendering a component to the screen.
    Often times, these components will use props in place of state to render different data.

1.  Describe state.

    state is the heart of the react application. It is what holds and updates the data for the application can use.

1.  Describe props.

    props is the blood of the application, as it is passed from component to component allowing the transfer of data (typically in a hierarchal
      fashion moving downwards).
