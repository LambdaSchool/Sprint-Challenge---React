### 1- a. What is React JS? 
 - ReactJS, build as a Javascript library to create **User Interfaces**, and the approach is to break it into small fragments of functional components/wedgits that as a whole represent the website.
- on a declarative scheme that define and say what each component/wedgit do directly, the bundel of JSX or the mix of (javascript and HTML combined with CSS) draw only HTML to the webpage, and as any other language, framework or library, it comes with already made methods to contorl the flow of the data. 

### 1- b. How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?
- Essentially, its a library not a framework, think of ReactJS as you think of JQuery!, *why?* because a Frameworke will include a Model-view-controller and inversion of control -LoC- and framework solve structural problems and inlcude a templates.

### 2- a- React Component Lifecycle!
- Splitting complex UI into smaller actions/methods, througthout these methods we can control how this particular component or even its child will behave on diffrent situations. starting with inializing the component to update it and then destroy/removing it. 

### 2- b- Three methods part of the lifecycle?
- 

### Class/Stateful component vs Functional/Presentational component
