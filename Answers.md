- ReactJs is a framework to handle the rendering of the page. It creates a virtual dom to quickly add or remove things to the page.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
- functions that are tried to be called on the page load.
- componentDidMount - add things to state after it mounts.
- render - render the elements to the page.
- componentWillMount - add things to state if it is able to mount.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a `Class/Stateful component` and a `Functional/Presentational component`.
- Functional does not handle state and does not extend Component.

- Class/Stateful manipulate data and handle changes.
