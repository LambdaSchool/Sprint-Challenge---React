1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Our class component can have functions inside of it while functional component can not. Class components also can have a state that can be mutated based off how the developer would like to change data on the screen. With class components using state means they have a lifecycle while our functional components can only return some JSX. Functional components are useful when we don't need state or functions for the particular component so they make some components clean.
