1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

A Javascript library that tries to solve the issue of scaleability and reuseability by giving developers a way to (easily) create reusable elements/components




2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    to be able to look at your code and asses the best ways and times to use components.



3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class components are the only ones that can use state and can also contain methods - that's the main difference this gives us the interactivity, functional components are used as a way to pass data to the main app itself (under the hood)


4.  Describe state.


 Quoting Ryan " State is the heart of every (class)component" it's what devs use to add interactivity and make our apps dynamic. It manages the data inputted by the user and/or api.

5.  Describe props.


 props are used to transfer your data between components both class and presentational
    Are read only and data flow is only one way (parent to child)
