1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a Javascript library that tries to help applications be more reactive. A big part of react it uses a Virtual DOM instead of allowing us to update the DOM manually which makes the process easier and less costly for performance.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I think it means to think component based and function based. Also build a static version before you before you make it interactive because it's not that big of a deal to make
things take state afterwards and it makes it easier.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Stateful components have state and are used more for getting your app to do something where as functional components are mainly just used for presentation. You can pass props around still but you can't pass state.

1.  Describe state.

I think of state as kind of the current display of data. If something happens that is targeted to change the state then the state can then be updated to a new state using setState. State can also be passed around as props which means state can be brought in.

1.  Describe props.

Props are objects that contain properties that all react objects can be passed. They are the data being passed around.
