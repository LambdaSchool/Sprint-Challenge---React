1.	React JS is an open source JavaScript library. It allows developers to create large web-applications that use and change data over time without reloading the page. React JS is different from other frameworks because uses Components, and the Data flow goes one way (state “reacts” to changes). 

2.	 React Component lifecycle
Intialization: getDefaultProps()/getInitialState()
Mounting: componentWillMount()  / componentDidMount()
Updating: componentWillUpdate()/ render() / componentDidUpdate()
Un-mounting: componentWillUnmount()


3.	Class Components can be Stateful or Stateless, but Stateful components are always Class Components. A Class Stateful Component has a state that gets initialized in the constructor. This state is passed to the children components as props.
Functional components do not have state, they take in the props (which are immutable and passed down form the Parent component that has state). Presentational Components accept props and render them. Unless state is required presentational components should be Functional components.

4.	The three arguments passed into the React.createElement() function are; type, props and children.
