1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a javascript framework developed by Facebook that allows for better web app development and management throught he use of state changes, components, and inheritance. The addition of React Native, which is not hte same as React, makes it possible for developers to use javascript to create all versions of the app for the web, iOS, and Android.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react means incorporating multiple concepts into one overarching approach to coding: One much think about, components and props, state and lifecycle, event handling, lifting state up, and composition and inheritance. It means that it's important to compartmentialize as much of one's app as possible, and make the code as Dry as possible: meaning the code should be both succinct and repeated code should be kept to a minimum. (less code, and clearer code is best)

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Presentational/functional components are more simple than class/stateful components and cannot make use of the life cycle methods in React. Functional/presentational components have the benefits of simplicity and testability but class/stateful components are where the real power of React resides. 

4.  Describe state.

State is an object on React components that determines how it renders and behaves and is a key enabler of allowing React components to be both dynamic and interactive.

5.  Describe props.

Props are custom, read-only parameters of React components.
