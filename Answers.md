1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a javascript extention used to create user interfaces via javascript objects.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in react means thinking in components.  Instead of creating an entire website in html one can use reusable componenets to display information to the user.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Function components are dumb as the only display a stateless object to the user.
Class components hold state and can access to methods to display or manipulate whats displayed to the user

4.  Describe state.

State is like a current screenshot of the DOM. It holds information as it currently is until it is manipulated and a react component is re-rendered.

5.  Describe props.

Props to me are like arguments to a function.  They can hold data and pass that data to a parent or child based on the name one gives it. For instance an Class component can pass it's method to a functional component as props.
