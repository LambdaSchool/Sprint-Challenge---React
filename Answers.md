1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?

React is a JavaScript Library.  Its purpose is to built powerful applications and React tries to solve the problem of providing a smooth experience for users as well as the ease of construction and deployment for developers.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.

The React Component lifecycle is the process by which developers controls what happens when each section in your UI renders,updates, thinks about re-rendering and then just dissapears completely. The three methods of the lifecycle are componentWilMount, componentDidMount and componentWillUnMount. in "componentWillMount" is the start of the process, and not much goes on here as your start to build your classes. in "compinentDidMount" is where you load your data,where you do your set up. In "componentWillUnmount" is where your component is going to go away, used to clean any left over debris it may have caused or where you want to terminate it.





3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional components are simpler than class components and provide less functionality.  They focus onthe UI and not your projects behavior and do not have the "this" keyword.  But Functional components are easier to read.  Class/Stateful components use the life cycle methods mentioned in previous question





4. Briefly describe PropTypes and what we use them for when building react applications.

PropTypes are used to ensure that components can be dynamic.  To have access to any dynamic data we want rendered to our component, we use PropTypes.
