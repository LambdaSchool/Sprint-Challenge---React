1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
   It helps with DOM manipulation as it contains its own virtual DOM which only changes DOM elements as necessary since manipulating the DOM is taxing performance-wise.
2. What does it mean to think in react?
   Thinking in react means breaking down an app into components that do a single function which can then be put together to make the app.
3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
   Class components allow for the data to change overtime and be updated. Functional is when the data does not need to change.
4. Describe state.
   State is the mechanism that react uses to determine how a component functions. It allows us to change and manipulate data.
5. Describe props.
   Props are the parameters passed to components in order to control what properties are of the element being created by the component.
