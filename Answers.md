1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a javascript library that stores a bunch of methods and tools to let us simplify making more dynamic components and data-accepting javascript elements. Facebook created it because it had no choice because of how many different data-dependent elements are on its site. 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    It means to think in terms of building these data-accepting apps. 

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    functional is if you just want to build a single component that creates a single thing. Class lets you build multiple components and children of components without having to create a bunch of new functions for those children. 

1.  Describe state.
    State stores permanent attributes inside the component and allows you to access and change those attributes through setState inside methods that are outside of the component. 

1.  Describe props.
    Props I probably understand the least but I think props are the attributes of elements that are stored in the separate .js files that work with the methods that are stored in the App.js file with the master component to create your software. For example, the form.js file used props to create a form that refers back to the methods in the App.js. props is what connects form.js to App.js.
