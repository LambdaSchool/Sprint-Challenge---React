1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A functional/presentational component is a very simple component that simply takes in props to use to render JSX; a class/stateful component can hold states, manipulate states, and direct other components.

    State is a object in a class component that holds various values and can be manipulated to change what is passed to other components/ what is displayed on the page.
