# Answers

1. React is a library for the 'view'. 
    It's a cheaper way to update content on a webpage than with the DOM.

2. Thinking in terms of state, props, and components (rather than in normal DOM terms).

3. A stateful component can hold state on it, 
    which allows it to be much more dynamic and controlled
    than a functional component.

4. State is an object that holds data for use with your components.
    State is only optionally present on class components.

5. Props are a way to pass down state via components, 
    along with passing down other props.
