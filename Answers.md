1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library that allows us to utilize the Virtual DOM to have a lot of control over the DOM, while the browser needs to worry less about the DOM. Allows for scalable UI.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

For me, I like to _think_ in React by separating different parts of a web application into components, and figuring out if I should further separate that component into other components. I don't like to clutter code, so I think separating different functionalities is key to having a nice, organized React application.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A class component, which extends from React.Component, allows us to have constructors and methods, which can be powerful. We can introduce state, which allows us to fully utilize React's library to render stuff onto the DOM depending on the state. A functional component is simpler, and we can utilize props that can be passed in, which we can use state for as well.

1.  Describe state.

I like to think of state as the current 'values' that are currently held by the application. It is accessible as data to all of our components, which is a powerful idea.

1.  Describe props.

I like to think of props as some data that we can pass into our components. JSX syntax + React allows us to pass in data, which can be rendered onto the DOM.
