1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a library that lets you use combine your HTML and Javacript by using JSX. It tries to relieve the DOM so it does not use as many resources by using the Virtual DOM. Also it tries to break down the application to components which keeps the information consumable for the developer and not overwhelm them.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

The thought process for thinking in react is that we need to break down the application into components so that we can keep it maintainable. Also having a classical component managing state and giving that information to its subcomponents, keeps the subcomponents cleaner and everything is found on the classical component for better organizing of code.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Class component updates the information so that the functional components can take that information and display it for the class component.

1.  Describe state.

State is the information that gets updated for the other components to use. It is like write (state) vs read (props).
