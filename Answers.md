1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is a JS library meant to make it easier to build highly scalable UIs with complex state environments. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in react is to become one with nature. It's to see past the surface of an entity and percieve its true nature as a montage of components - and to realize the subtle 'stateful' energies that holds them together and animate them dynamically. Ha. 

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A stateful component is a component that generally holds the state of an application and is where methods and different forms of state are passed down throughout the application to other functional components. 
Functional components are usually tasked with completing a specific task and representing a small part of the UI.  

4.  Describe state.
State represents information meant to change through the lifecycle of the application.

5.  Describe props.
Props are packages of state that allow it to be passed down and accessed by from a class component to other components.
