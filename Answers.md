1. React JS is a Framework for JavaScript developed by Facebook that enables the developer to combine HTML and JS elements into unified files. Notable distinguishing features include an object-oriented, component-driven architecture; JSX syntax for embedding HTML and JavaScript together; and the virtual DOM (a memory object that represents the real DOM in memory but allows React to only update whatever components of the DOM have actually been changed each time the page is re-rendered).
2. There are four phases to the component lifecycle: initialization, mounting, updates, and unmounting. In the initialization phase, the _getInitialState()_ and _getDefaultProps()_ methods are called once (and only once) when the component is first created and can be used to set the initial values of _this.state_ and _this.props_. Next, the component is _mounted_ (_i.e._ rendered for the first time), and the method _componentWillMount()_ is called exactly once immediately before _render()_, and _componentDidMount()_ is called immediately afterward. The next phase is updating, which happens any time _this.state_ changes. The first method called is _shouldComponentUpdate()_, which must return a boolean telling React whether or not to re-render the component. If the return value is true, first _componentWillUpdate()_ is called, then _render()_, then _componentDidUpdate()_. The same update cycle occurs if _this.props_ is changed instead of _this.state_, except that one additional method, _componentWillReceiveProps()_, which allows _this.state_ to be updated to reflect the changes to _this.props_ without causing the component to be re-rendered, is called before _shouldComponentUpdate()_. Finally, we have the unmounting phase, which consists of a single method, _componentWillUnmount()_, which is called just before the component is destroyed.
3. A Class/Stateful component is declared using the _Class_ keyword and inherits from _React.Component_. It has a constructor, which must call _super();_ as its first line of code. It maintains a _state_ object that can be used to maintain component data throughout the component's lifecycle. Its purpose is usually to provide functionality and logic as well as presentation. A Functional/Presentational component is simply declared with an arrow function that (usually, at least) accepts a _props_ object as a parameter. It does not have a _state_ object, and since the _props_ object is read-only and is reset every time the parent component is re-rendered, functional components are usually fairly limited in the amount of logical processing they can do. Mostly, their purpose is to take the data passed to them via the _props_ object and present it in a meaningful way.
