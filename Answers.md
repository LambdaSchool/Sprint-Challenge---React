* READ THIS FIRST *
** I did not google any of this. If these sprint challenges are designed to gauge how I am grasping the topic, then you need to know that I really don't know that much more about React now than I did Monday. I wanted to give you an accurate picture of where I'm at with this. **


* What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks? * 
**  I have no idea, really. **
* Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do. *
** Initialize - Mount - Render - Unmount **
** I am pretty vague on this, but Initialize is creating the app, Mounting is putting all the components in the app, Render is ????, and Unmount, I guess, is removing things? I'm not really sure. **
* Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. *
** Class/Stateful components are changeable and are better for more complex components, functional are not changeable and are for the simpler components of your app. **
* Name the three arguments that are passed into the React.createElement() function? *
** Nope, sorry. I have no idea. **
