1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

        React is a REACTive javascript library that allows for large amounts of reusability and REACTs to updates in its database in real time.






2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

        Thinking in react means thinking in terms of the future. Taking into account re-usability by breaking down your webpage into individual components
        and utilizing class calling and the this keyword to directly collect information from the state.






3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

        Functional components are the simpler of the two. It is a javascript function that takes props and returns JSX to render a webpage. Class
        components on the otherhand or sort of (in my opinion) an upgraded version of functional components. They do everything a functional component
        does and more. You get the use of internal state and life-cycle methods! With more usability comes a few extra lines of code, but not much. All
        class components will need to extend the react component and also utilize the render component.






4.  Describe state.

        State is pretty much a big database on your webpage that holds all of your data and distributes it on a need-be basis. This information may
        not be modified outside the scope of its base component.






5.  Describe props.

        Props is the information that gets passed down from the state itself. I always think of it as sort of the middle man. Without props
        we would not be able to pass information from parent to child.
