1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
  React is a library that allows for us to make changes to a wesbsite without having
  to update the entire DOM with every change. React saves memory, creates a smoother experience and allows us to create scalable components to fit any size project.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
   Thinking in React all comes down to thinking in components, functional and class components, managing our data by determining whether its going to be in state or props.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
  A class component handles our state, we want most of our data to be stored in our class components, a class component using a constructor function and extends the React class giving us all kinds of extra functionality. A functional component is used mostly not to deal with our data or state, but it decides what to do with it and how to present it on the screen. 

1.  Describe state.
  State is the changing data that goes in our class component.

1.  Describe props.
  Props are more static data that serves to define our functional components/
