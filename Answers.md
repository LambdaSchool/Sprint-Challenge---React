1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?

- React is open source framework for building single page application. React uses component based approach for building javascript and hence it is more modular.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.

- Lifecycle method controls what will happens when each tiny section of UI renders, updates, re-renders.

- Some of the life cycle methods are:
1) componentDidMount
2) componentWillUpdate
3) componentWillUnmount  

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

- Class components extends React.Component. Class component has ability to maintain state of the class and render UI as per change in state property.

- Functional componets on the other hand does not maintain state. It is used when we only want to display component.
