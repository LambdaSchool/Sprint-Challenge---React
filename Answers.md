1. React JS is a front-end UI that was developed by Facebook. It is meant to be modularly based and resuable. It's different from other frameworks because it easily integrates with other code and doesn't reign the user down to specific settings that would not be used outside of React.
2. The React Component Lifecycle  describes  the coding stages of a component in React. Which is initializaion, mounting, and any changes that occur during rendering and unmounting. Three methods used as an example are `componentDidMount()`, `componentWillUpdate()`, and `shouldComponentUpdate()`.
3. Class/Stateful components have state, use lifecycle methods and use the `this` keyword and have access to `props`. Functional/Presentational components focus how the UI looks such and rendering HTML through JSX.
