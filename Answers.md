1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

  - ReactJS is a front-end framework that solves the problem of efficiently compartmentalizing different aspects of a web page, and providing silos for each compartment (component) to transfer information to each other.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

  - I suppose this means that you think of your web application in small independent pieces? It's a more methodical way of crafting applications which is probably another subtle reason why React is more maintainable in larger systems.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

  - A Functional/Presentational component doesn't hold state while a Class/Stateful component will.

4.  Describe state.

  - State in this sense is the ability to store variables to form a cohesive snapshot of what your web application will look like at any given point based upon the stage of user interaction.

5.  Describe props.

  - I think of props as the container for all state within a particular object.
