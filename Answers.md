1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
-Probably that we should break our app into a bunch of components and give them a single responsability, and that we have props and state.
1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
basically Class components can have state while Functional components can't.
1.  Describe state.
state is an object where we save the data we want our components have access to and should be always modified trough the setState built-in API.
1.  Describe props.
props for me are like custom attributes in our Children components, and its purposeis to handle the data that we want our components have access to, usually this data comes from the Parent Component's state. and you can pass props down(always down).
