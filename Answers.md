1: ReactJS differs in that it allows the use of a virtual DOM, which is a localized and simplified version of the HTML DOM. It does it's calculations there as opposed to the "real" DOM, which is usually faster. 
2:The lifecycle of a component goes from mounted, where the react component is rendered as html elements to the DOM. In this phase some examples wouldbe getInitialState, which allows you to set the initial state and getDefaultProps, which sets the initial props. It then moves on to the change phase, where you could use shouldComponentUpdate, which returns a boolean, or componentWillUpdate which prepares for the update based on that boolean. Finally we unmount with componentWillUnmount.  
3:A class/stateful component is typically used when we need to store some piece of data and pass it into another scope. A functional/presentational component on the other hand simply accepts an input and does something with it.  
4:The first argument passed into .createElement is the type of element we're creating. The second is and object containing props to be passed into the component. The third is the child of that component.
