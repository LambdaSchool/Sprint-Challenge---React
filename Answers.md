1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    A: React JS is a javascript library used to write HTML and javascript directly in the same file. We use this to create components that are composed of many components that can be placed on webpages. It is used when we are creating one object multiple times and to simplify what is being ran/rendered.
