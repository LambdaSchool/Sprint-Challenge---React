1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a framework created by the Facebook team. It's a framework that can help us build extremely large and complex applications through breaking them down into individual components.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

"Thinking in React" means to think in terms of components. It's the ability to look at an application, or as you build one, to think in terms what the job of an individual component is and how it will work with other components to render the desired application or product.`

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Functional component does not hold state. A Class component does indeed hold stae.

4.  Describe state.

State is basically the state of the application; it's the state the appication is in. State changes as a user interacts with the app though events.

5.  Describe props.

Props are passed through components. They are basically properties (which props is short for). Properties can be passed through components so that as a user interacts with the application (or as state changes there on) the application can respond and change.
