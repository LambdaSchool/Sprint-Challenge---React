1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a framework that allows for the developer to build out components on a large scale easily. It allows for
the application to be updated quickly so it can be deployed rapidly.
1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
You "think" as how React would look at breaking down a component. Then you build it out in parts so that it functions as
a working application with many components.
1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class components are used to store state and to render it. Functional components are used to accept props from the state
and then use that to perform a function and send it back to Class component.
1.  Describe state.
State is used to store data, and can be used to create, read, update, and delete information.
1.  Describe props.
Props is short for property, in which it can be used to push data from the state.
