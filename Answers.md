        **Sprint-Challenge---React**

_1._ React: React is a flexible Javascript library maintains state. It creates UI interfaces by efficiently updating and rendering components.

    How react differ from other JS frameworks: 
    1. Fast rendering and updates.
    2. Easy interface designs
    3. Fully components based architecture.
    

_2._ React Component Lifecycle: Starting from pre-mounting each UI renders, updates, re- renders and then disappears. 
    1. _Constructor_ are the basic of OOP. This is special function called whenever a new object is created. 

    2. _componentWillMount_ will be called only once in intial mounting life cycle. It happens before render is called.

    3. _componentDidMount_ will be called only once in life cycle of a component and it is being called signalized that the component and its sub components rendered properly.

_3._Differences between Class/Stateful component and Functional/Presentational component:
Class component maintains state, so offers more features. Often passes object through _props_ to chiold component. Functional component is JS function often receives input through _props_.
