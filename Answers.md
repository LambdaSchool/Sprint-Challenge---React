1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    It is a library of JS code. It can display large amounts of data, potentially from multiple sources or users, without slowing down the ability of the DOM to render things to the screen. React also lends itself well to writing reusable code pieces called components which for one makes coding more DRY and makes it easier for multiple people to work on the same projet. React also makes it possible for a single person to create an application when the same app may have taken an entire team.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    The ability to imagine the flow of data from parents to children in the DOM tree, and vice versa. It is not simply left to right, top to bottom like reading a book.
1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    State is an object that tells components how they will render to the DOM/screen.
