1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
 - React is a library for building applications. From what I gather, React is primarily used for user interaction - adding/removing/interacting with HTML elements through JSX language. We use functional and class components that each do one particular thing (single responsibility) and weave them together using imports/exports into our App.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
 - To think in react means to think of everything as components and to break full webpages down into it's components.
