1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a library built mainly by Facebook and is used to build large-scale applications quickly. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react simply means thinking in terms of your application and the components you'll need to combine and how to make your app.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A class component has classes and state (like a constructor) and a funtional component is just a function. It takes in input called props.

4.  Describe state.

State is the heart of every React component. Basically state is an object that determines how the app renders and behaves.

5.  Describe props.

Props are properties passed into and through react componenets. It's basically passing in an object named props with key value pairs of whatever you assign as you pass them through.
