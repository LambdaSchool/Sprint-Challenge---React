1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a javascript library and it creates a smoother user interaction with a website. It also allow for reusable code in the form of components. It creates a website in a virtual DOM and compares the difference in a users current page and changes the different element. This make reloading the entire page unnecessary.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I found that with react i have to think of building a website different. Instead of just links on a page leading to other pages I think of where the state lives & components , hoe one component passes info to the other.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class:
has State
has lifecycle
can have instances

Functional:
no State
no lifecycle
can access props
no "this"



1.  Describe state.
 holds info for the render. accessed and managed within components. Mutable

1.  Describe props.

aka properties - holds info for the render. get passed to components. Immutable
