1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    * React JS is a library made to do one thing very efficiently and that is make UI with fast performance and easy. In the past we would have to use the DOM to handle user input and that would cost a lot of computation power. The Facebook developers decided to make a library that renders UI in a way that handles user input using as less computation power as possible but still does the job. 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    * For me what it means is to take advantage of the React Library and separate the website in chunks of reusable code that can be reused through the website. 

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    * Some of the differences are that class components that are stateful provide us with data that we can use through all our components for example if you have a class app with some state you can assign properties to the other components using that state. We can later on modify the state through setState or add new key values making this data dynamic when rendering UI. 
    
    * Functional components are used mostly to provide the visual representation of the UI. They don't hold state data but since they are functions they can take advantage of the state data on a previous component and as long as the property is assigned to this functional component it can use that data.
