1. React JS is a component based javascript framework or library. It has one way data binding and used jsx for mockup similar to html.

2. The three parts of lifecycle methods are...
componentWillMount - this method will run before the component gets rendered to the dom.
componentDidMount - this method will run after the component gets rendered to the dom.
componentWillUnmount - this method will run right before the component gets deleted.

3. Class components are considered 'smart' component, they have their own states. Functional components are dumb components, all they do is receive data/props from the smart components and render them.
