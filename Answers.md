# 1) 'UI code is readable and maintainable''Creating UI components allows for modularity and code reusability' 'React can be rendered on both client and server side' 'It uses a concept called Virtual DOM that selectively renders subtrees of nodes upon state changes'
# 2) Every component has lifecycle methods that let you run code at specific times (Mounting: called when component is being created and inserted into the dom, Updating: caused when component is being re-rendered, Unmounting: called when component is removed from DOM)
# 3) Functional component: just javascript functions, take an input which we call props and return a piece of the DOM. Class components: have more features and inheritance, primarily they have `state`..
