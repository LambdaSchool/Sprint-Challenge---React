1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is a JavaScript Library.

When dealing with Stateful components and updating the virtual DOM, React changes just the elements whose state changes and renders that. All other elements stay the same.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react means to break down similar elements in your application into bits of reusable code called components, then using these components as a framework to store props.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/Stateful component has state that will change whereas functional/presentational components will just render props

4.  Describe state.
State is a light bulb. Either it is on or it is off. In regards to an element, it's either empty or it has props in it.

5.  Describe props.
Props (properties) are information in the element.
