1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
react put simply is a javascript library for building user interface. the problem it trys to solve is the complexity when it comes to user interfaces there is a lot of behind the scene code that helps us,the react user, create and do really cool functionalities that otherwise would be a bit harder

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
I think that "to think in react" means that you are thinking about what interface you are building by what components will need to be built and in what order should they be called. i.e which component is going to be your parent? Will it have state? How will the children descend off of the parent? and where and when will you change your state if set

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
from my understanding class/stateful components hold state and can change state causing a re-render of that component where as in functional/presentational components may still hold some sort of functionality but they do not hold state and wont re render in the same way that stateful components do.

1.  Describe state.
state is the initial display of your "stuff" and can be changed 
1.  Describe props.
props are what is passed down to children in order to possibly change state?
