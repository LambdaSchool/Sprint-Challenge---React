1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
	React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JS library(framework) for building user interfaces and render views.
	Because of its reusable components and unique data rendering approach, the web interfaces you create with react are
	flexible, fast, and lightweight.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
	Each component has several lifecycle methods that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. Methods
	prefixed with "will" are called right before something happens, and methods prefixed with did are called right after something 
	happens.
	Three components: Render, ComponentWillMount, and ComponentWillUnmount

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
	Functional components are used for presenting static data, they cannot handle fetching data.
	Class components are used for dynamic source of data and can handle any data that might change.
