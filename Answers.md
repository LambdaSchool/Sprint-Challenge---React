1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a Javascript library, in which, by building reusable and compartmentalized chunks of code called components, we are able to quickly and effieciently scale UI projects. React makes use of a virtual DOM, and once rendered, makes concise changes to the actual DOM.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in React is about breaking your project into components. A component should be potentially reusable, and do one thing. By builing and layering with these components we are able to achieve a fully fleshed out application.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Functional components are built with functions(Wait?! What?! No way!?). They are stateless by nature. A class component allows us a bunch of useful functionality already built into the React.Component parent component. With it we are able to give it state and make 'reactive' changes to data-state changes. There also needs to be an included render function in a React class component.

1.  Describe state.
State is essentially data,in object form which represents the current 'state' of our program. By using this state and monitoring changes to it, we can use functions to make changes to our apps.

1.  Describe props.
Props is an argument(?) that passes along objects from other functions to be used in our current component.
