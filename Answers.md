1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? ReactJS is a JavaScript library that tries to solve the problem of tedious DOM manipulation. Making components dynamic and thus allowing us to build bigger-scale applications in way less time and less code is the problem React tries to solve. 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react? Thinking in react means to break things into different components. Things can be divided into several components and written that way. 

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. The difference comes from what the component's responsibility is. If a component's main responsibility is to simply display a set of data, state is not necessary and thus a functional component can be used. 

1.  Describe state. State is the memory that our component is concerned with, without state our component would be static. 

1.  Describe props. Props is how we pass state around to make our components dynamic. Every component has a prop, whether we declare it or not.
