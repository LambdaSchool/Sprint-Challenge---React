1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

when thinking about a project or writing code think of it in partitioned sections or components with a structural hierarchy that have the ability to adapt to changes

1. Describe state.

state is an object given to components that stores variable data so therefore allows the component to re-render with the new data

1. Describe props.

props are used to pass read-only arguments to component functions that are rendered in the dom using jsx

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

side effects are any of the changes or effects happening outside of the scope of the current function, we use hooks to sync these effects
