1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React JS is a library created by the facebook team, that is meant to speed up development of web apps.
It is component based, you create your own components that are reusable and it also has the JSX syntax
that is kind of like xhtml.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
Component life cycle methods are methods like the constructor(), render(), and componentDidMount() that serve a
specific purpose in the life of the comonent like mounting, updating and unmounting.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
A class stateful component may or may not receive its own this.state data, may have multiple methods, and will have a render function.
A functional component will receive props or properties and and run calculations on that and just return some JSX.
