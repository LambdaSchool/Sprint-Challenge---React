1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?

React is a JS library that we can play dynamic data. Its reusable components and easy data rendering way helps developers to have rapid, dry-friendly code.


2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.

With the help of life cycle methods, we are in charge of how each section and components act.

--- componentWillMount is executed before rendering, on both the server and the client side.

--- componentDidMount is executed after the first render only on the client side

--- componentWillUpdate is called just before rendering.


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/Stateful components enable us to have an independent state that we cana dd new properties.

Functional/Presentational--We can have props but no state, no this keyword or life cycle methods. They simply render a JSX component.
