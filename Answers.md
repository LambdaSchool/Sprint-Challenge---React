1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a library we use to build out user interfaces built to deal with a lot of data that changes over time without slowing down the DOM

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react means that you're breaking down your app into simple components that would then be rendered to build your app

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A functional component is just a function that returns the JSX we use to make up our DOM elements

A Class component is a class which extends React.Component which allows it to have access to some useful tools, such as internal state, life cycle hooks and the render method

4.  Describe state.

state is an object which houses the data our own objects and components have both continual access to and the ability to update

5.  Describe props.

props is an object that holds data which is passed into our components as a parameter, but the data in props cannot be updated/is immutable
