### 1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is an unopinionated Javascript library that is made up of components and HTML. The components are reusable and allows you to quickly build user interfaces that aren't reliant on the loading of every component. If one component hasn't loaded yet, the others will load. React JS is extremely scalable.

### 2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
React JS is based on the idea of breaking things down in to as simple as possible and building components from that.

### 3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Functional components are more for presentation and will manipulate DOM elements to put stuff on the screen while Class components are going to gain access to state and can cause state to change.

### 4.  Describe state.
State is the data within a component and can change with user interactions.

### 5.  Describe props.
Props are attributes that are passed from parent to child components that allow us to utilize certain attributes from the parent to other components that we want to have it.
