1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is UI component library built in JS. It was developed to help manage more complex state.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
In my view, it means thinking in components. Looking at a mockup, for example, like in the 'Thinking in React' page and breaking down a project into single responsibility components.


1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class/stateful: these components can have state and methods which means they are typically much more robust and dynamic.
Functional components: Essentially just JS functions which can take in props

1.  Describe state.
State is encompassed in the component in which it is declared, and its scope is limited to that component.
1.  Describe props.
Props, on the otherhand are just properties that cannot be passed from child to parent. They are passed into a component in a way that's similar to passing an argument into a function.
