1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library that allows you to design the user-interface portion of an application by fluidly integrating JS with HTML and CSS. Building apps in this way also enables an aspect of reusability across a design.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in React means to approach a design with the single responsibility principle in mind, thinking about what components make up your design, and what heirarchy those components have.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/Stateful components are the base or parent components which have a state set up in the constructor, and render the data in your design down to the other components.
Functional/Presentation components are the child components which use functions with props to change the data held in the parent to do whatever functional or presentational thing we want to render to our app.

1.  Describe state.

State is an object set up in the class/stateful component that determines how your app will render or "behave" according to the functions you create.

1.  Describe props.

"Props" is the keyword representing the inputs used in functional/presentation components to describe what we want to appear in our design.
