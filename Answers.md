1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    -ReactJS is a JavaScript UI library. It tries to help us solve the problem of building powerful applications which provide a smooth experience for the users and developers.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    - It means that you want to think about the apps as you build them. You want to break down the UI into a component hierachy. Then you want to build a static version in React. Then you need to think about state in your app, where state should live, and how data will flow in the app.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    -Functional/presentational components are used for composing DOM elements. Don't have state, thus no access to this. Class/Stateful componenets have access to lifecycle methods. Have access to this. 

1.  Describe state.
    - State is an object that determines how a componenet renders and behaves. 

1.  Describe props.
    - Props are read only. Props stands for properties. React will pass JSX attributes to other components as props. This allows our components to be more dynamic.
