1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
   
React is a JavaScript library for building UIs. React is really useful because it is declarative, the data flows in one direction, useful because you can compose classes/functions into one another, and React has a Virtual DOM which makes updating the real DOM efficient. The biggest obstacle React tackles is managing and updating State in an application.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    Thinking in react means seeing an application and mentally breaking the application down into small components that get woven together to build the final product.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A functional component doesn't manage it's own state while a class component usually does.

4.  Describe state.
   State determines how objects render and behave. State also allows us to create dynamic and interactive components.

5.  Describe props.
Props are similar to arguments. Props are a way of passing data down through components.
