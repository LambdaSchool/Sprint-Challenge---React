1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

Essentially, React is a js library we can use to build user interfaces. It was built internally at FB then open sourced in 2013. Some of its features include reusability and the ability to use it on client and server side which allows us to build full websites with only React. You get faster page loads because the virtual dom creates a cache and only changes what needs to be changed. A nice add on for us as LS students is that React borrows a lot from Vanilla JS so weâ€™ve got a nice jump on the syntax.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Breaking the UI into components, creating a hierarchy, identifying parent-child relationships, figuring out where state lives and where props can go.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional components take in props
Are defined by const
Often use arrow functions

Class components can have state which offers ore features
They use CCR
Stateful components use this.state, setState, etc.

1.  State vs props: State is where we hold our memory. Props is the mechanism that allows us to pass our state around.
