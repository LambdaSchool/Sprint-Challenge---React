1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is an API/library that makes it a lot easier for us to use class components and functional components to build sites that can use and pass state and props around. More importantly state. I mean, I could go on and on here, or even just put the whole paragraph from the training kit, but i think the above is a short sweet version? lol I hope anyway 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To be able to think about the components and the passing of state and props in such a way that you can pass them easily between components and tie them all together with ease

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Biggest difference is syntax, as functional components are just js functions that hold props as an argument and returns a react element. 
Functional components cannot use state, where class components have the option.
Using functional components can make your code much shorter. 

1.  Describe state.
State is data that is held in a class and can be manipulated there or passed down to children as props

1.  Describe props.
Props are properties? Used for class components if applied, or for functional component children, etc
