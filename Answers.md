1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React is magic and should be handle with the upmost care. Magic can be dangerous if used in unexperienced hands.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
constructor - builds our objects to be used. render - returns data to be used in a certain way. componentDidMount - handles changes to the data and calls render?

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
One is light magic and the other is dark magic...I have no clue and I am going to do a lot of reading over the weekend to make sense of everything from this week.
