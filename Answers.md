1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React is a front-end framework that was designed and created by the guys over at Facebook. The main difference between other JavaScript frameworks is React is ONLY front-end. Other key differences are how popular it is, that it's updated constantly with fresh content, and simply how powerful the framework is.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
The lifecycles are methods that can be overriden at particular times in a process.

Mounting: This is where a component is created and put in the DOM, like a constructor function.
Updating: This is called when a component is being re-rendered, like a render function.
Error Handling: We covered this a bit I believe in the form of PropTypes, where your code checks itself for specific things like arrays or objects in imported data.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
A class component can have state, where a functional component cannot. Functional components are literally just javascript functions that take an optional input.
