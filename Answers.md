1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
     React JS is a Javascript framework used for buiding user interfaces. React allows us to dynamically update parts of the DOM as needed, without updating the entire DOM.
2. What does it mean to _think_ in react?
     The main aspect of "thinking in React" is the idea of breaking a UI into a hierarchy of components each with their own responsibility(ies).
3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a           Functional/Presentational component.
    Functional components don't have state, don't have life cycle methods, don't have a `this`, and are
    pure functions, which makes them easier to test and reason about.
4. Describe state.
     State is a Javascript object which holds information and is managed/changed from within a 
     (Classical) Component.
5. Describe props.
     Props is a Javascript object which holds information, is passed down to a Component, and is immutable.
