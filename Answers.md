1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    - React JS is a very popular Javascript library created by the developers at Facebook. It is geared toward creating fast and powerful UI (through reusable components, state and props, and the virtual DOM). Given that modern websites and web apps are feature and interactivity rich, React supplies a way to lessen the burden on the real DOM, allowing these sites to perform more quickly.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    - Thinking in React essentially involves following the best method of creating a React web app. This means thinking of the project in terms of components, sorting those components in a hierarchy, creating a stateless version of your project, inputing the minimum appropriate data into state, figuring out which component(s) should hold state, and adding inverse data flow where necessary.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    - The main difference between Class components and Functional components is that Functional components do not have the ability to hold state. Instead, they reference the state of Class components through props.

1.  Describe state.

    - State is the mutable data within a web app. State holds this data and is updated and rerendered when it is manipulated by some component in the project/web app.

1.  Describe props.

    - Props is immutable data used in a web app. State can be passed down to child components through props.
