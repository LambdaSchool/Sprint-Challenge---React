1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?              
    React is a Javascript component library used for building user interfaces.
2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Thinking in React refers to the way we think about how data flows between components within the UI using state and props, and building things to make this flow efficient.
3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    The main difference between class components and functional components is that class components can have state or not, whereas functional components do not have state and typically are used to present elements to the DOM. 
4.  Describe state.
    State is the data your app has access to when it is being interacted with by the user. 
5.  Describe props.
    Props (for properties) is an object that can be passed as an argument to components to allow sharing of state data amongst themselves.
