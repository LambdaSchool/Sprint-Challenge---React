1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?  
React JS is a Javascript library for building UIs efficiently. It allows us to take a big project and split it into smaller, manageable pieces.  

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?  
Thinking in react means to split up the UI into components and arranging them in a hierarchy where data flows from parent to child and inversely.  

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.  
Class/Stateful components contain state that allows them to track how data has changed over time and re-render accordingly.  
Functional components do not contain state and usually just display data that is passed down as props.  

1.  Describe state.  
State is a mutable object that is used for tracking changes over time. React allows us to use state to re-render components instead of the entire app. State is contained in a single component.  

1.  Describe props.  
Props is an immutable object containing properties that are passed down from parent to child.
