1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a JavaScript library for building interactive UIs via reusable components. It makes use of the virtual DOM to handle changes in the view layer and makes it easier for development teams to build large scale applications.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in React means looking at a UI and breaking it down in terms of components, down to single purpose elements. It also involves thinking of these UI components in terms of their props, states and the data and events passed between them.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class components can hold states in addition to what Functional components do, which is merely return elements for display. Function components are formed similar to JS functions, whereas Class components look lie JS classes with constructors that extend React.Component.

1.  Describe state.
State is data that a component holds that may change over time.

1.  Describe props.
Props refer to the property argument that passes read-only data to a component.
