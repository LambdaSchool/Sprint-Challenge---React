1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks? React JS is a open-source Javascript library made by Facebook. It focuses on performance and intuitive design. It allows reuse of code and has an easy to understand import structure. It is also fully component based unlike many others.


2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do. componentWillMount is called before render is executed it also pulls a component. componentDidMount is called when the render is executed. render basically returns the component and what you would want on the app/page.


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class uses es6 style classes and is useful if it needs access to this or lifecycle methods. Functional is closer to es5 and uses props instead of this. Functional is overall more readable and easier to test but lacks some utility that can be found in Class components.
