1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React JS is a fast and scalable framework for simplifying the building of interactive user interfaces via encapsulated components.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    To fragment the functional pieces of an application into components so that they may work independently of their containing parts.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    Classes can have state while functions can not. Functions are used more for presentation, while classes contain the logic of an app. If your app doesn't need state, functions provide a cleaner way to create your app, cutting down on code and complexity.

4.  Describe state.
    State represents the values of the moving parts of your app at render.

5.  Describe props.
    Props are the immutable values passed down from state that components in your app work with.
