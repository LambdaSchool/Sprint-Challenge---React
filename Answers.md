### 1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
        React JS is a javascript library that allows a developer to make components, manage state, and manipulate the DOM effieciently.
### 2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
        Thinking in React means to think about compartmentalizing the DOM and building components from that model. 
### 3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
        Class/Stateful components hold data and are the only place where the data should be updated. 
        Functional/Presentational component are components that have JSX code that produces HTML elements. They are containers to hold other components, have CSS classes, and contain data that is not to be managed. 
### 4.  Describe state.
        State in React is the most updated data for a given application. The state can change depending on user input, other data in the state, or an asynchronous event. 

### 5.  Describe props.
        Props are used to progagate data from a parent component to a child component. As the state changes from the root element or a parent element, child components will receive the updated state through props.
