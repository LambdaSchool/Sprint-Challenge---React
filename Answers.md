1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

 ReactJS is a JavaScript library which builds user interfaces using reusable UI components. It allows for easier to scale applications and is simpler for use to accessing the DOM compared to vanilla Javascript.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

 The React way of thinking is to break down a UI into hierarchical components.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

 A class component uses methods in the Component Lifecycle and uses state to read and update the UI.
 A functional component is a simple component that accepts props as an argument and returns JSX.

4.  Describe state.

 State is stored in and managed by the component, and renders what you see displayed by an app at a given point.

5.  Describe props.

 Props are passed into components by the original component.
