**What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?**

*First of all, React is a Library, not a Framework, for very specific reasons. The React library itself doesn't look to solve any structural or architechtural problems in an application -- it's completely structure agnostic. All it does is use a components-based idealogy to help break user interfaces down into reusable components that can be used all over websites. React doesn't care how you implement it or what you do with that power -- it's just there to help you do what you need to do. Frameworks tend to define entire application ecosystems.

As for how React is different than other JavaScript libraries, I don't think that it's too different than some of them, at a very high level. jQuery exists to modify the DOM easily and help developers create user interfaces. So does React, just better.

On a very micro-level, React differs from other libraries because it allows developers to split their user interface into little chunks that can be reused over and over again throughout an entire codebase. It brings the organizational and convenience benefits of JavaScript (i.e. functions and classes) into the usage of HTML.*
