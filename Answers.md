2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
    The stage process through where the components go through and are invoked in a certain order.
    Render- returns something everytime it is called.
    ComponentDidMount- gets called as soon the DOM knows what it is rendering and it is useful to fetch data.
    ComponentWillMount- fetches data right away before the DOM renders.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4. Briefly describe PropTypes and what we use them for when building react applications.
    If a component is not given a required prop or is given the wrong type for one of its props then React will give an error to let you know.
