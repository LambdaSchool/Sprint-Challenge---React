1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React JS is a JavaScript library that focuses on the UI of a application or a website. The difference between React JS and the other frameworks is the major one, React is not a framework but a library but a very powerful library. It is excellent in major web app productions and its codes are reusable. This library is constantly receiving updates almost at an instant so it will always be current and excellent for debugging. Lastly it allows the server to create applications almost flawlessly and easily.


2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
React Component Lifecycle is a process that takes place before and after the render method to avoid a re-render process. The three methods that are used before the render method are: componentWillMount, componentDidMount, and componentWillReceiveProps. In the componentWillMount, this takes place at the very beginning in the initiation phase. It is basically setting things up to be executed. In the componentDidMount, is used when there is a delayed execution of instructions you want to take place throughout your application. This is also where the updates to the DOM will also takes place. Lastly, componentWillReceiveProps is 'invoked as soon as the props are updated before another render is called.' With this being said, basically the 'child' props will be giving set instructions to the 'parent' to be rendered when the state is updated.


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Differences between Class/Stateful component and Functional/Presentational component: In Class components, you will be using the constructor and super methods to render props. In Functional component, you will be using what is similar to a JS function but using the ES6 syntax of the arrow function which will take in an input of some kind.
