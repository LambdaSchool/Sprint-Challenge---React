What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?

React is a javascript library that is built to create user interfaces.. it was created by facebook and used by tons, and tons, of other companies..


Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
mounting - 
this is when the instance of a component is being put into the dom so like render is one of these methods so is a constructor..
updating -
updating is after a change happens then it updates by re-rendering the components, Also render again is an updating method 
unmounting - 
this is what happens when you remove the component fromt he DOM.. I had to look up an example for this and componentWillUnmount is the only example it gave..

error handling -
this is what happens if there is an error when you try to render, Again I had to look this up and the only one I found was componentDidCatch

Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

So a stateful class is smart and a function component is dumb, From what I understand is that stateful class components deal with state and functional components deal better with presentation like styling and etc.. I could be wrong as if you want to know my weakest area then this is it..State and stateless are still a little bit blurry in my head
