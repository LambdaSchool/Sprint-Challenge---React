1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    - what: 
    A user interface component library. A library in JavaScript, we use the components to build out user interfaces. React uses these encapsulated pieces of UI called Components that concern themselves with their own individual pieces of the DOM. React uses an engine called the Virtual DOM to update any changes that will be made over time to our applications. The idea is to be efficient.

    - why: 
    Facebook developed React because it solved some of the major problems the team was facing dealing with complex state. Each web page has some sort of data that is state data. State is linked with functionality, important for a reactive website.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    - React makes building web pages easier by breaking down each section and sub section into components which give websites a modular-like build which in itself required a very different way of thinking when building web apps compared to our conventional form of building a website through HMLT, CSS and JavaScript. React allows us to pick up and drop components anywhere on the web page and te HTML, CSS and JS that's with it stays encapsulated and is never compromised. Keeping all that in mind as you build your web app is thinking in React!

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4.  Describe state.

    - State is sometimes described as the 'heart' of a react application. Heart's job is to take in blood and distribute that blood throughout the body, allow the rest of us to work. State is the data that our components can hold onto and pass around to other components. When state updates so to will our components thus making them 'react.'

5.  Describe props.

    - Every component can receive props. With our functional component you can receive it as an argument as a props object that you can use in that component. Think of props as the blood that the heart pumps throughout the system. Props are immutable.
