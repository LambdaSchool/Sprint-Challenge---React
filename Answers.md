To think in React is to think of an application as a collection of components. Each application can be split into smaller parts that make up the whole. Sometimes these parts are reusable in other applications as well. 

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Class component has the state property which allows the Component to hold state. A Functional component is a function that can take in a props parameter which can then pass data around components.
