#What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks?
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building User Interfaces.

#Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the life cycle and what they do.

The React Component Lifecycle is indicative of just that, an apps life cycle. This means that when an app is first started, this is it's birth. The apps usage is considered it's growth. When the app is closed or navigated away from, this implies it's death.

Three methods associated with the Lifecycle are as follows:

Birth: ReactDOM.render()
Growth: setState()
Death: componentDidMount()

#Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Some differences between a Class/Stateful Component and a Functional/Presentational Component are as follows:

Class/Stateful: This type of component is always class based. It comes with greater abilities than the functional counterpart. When dealing with a Stateful Component, its behavior is dependant on its state.

Functional/Presentational: This type of component doesn't deal with State. It is reusable and allows you to get by without having to use the "this" keyword.
