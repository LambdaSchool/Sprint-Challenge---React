1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It helps with reusability by using components and allows web pages to use large amounts of data by only updating affected components rather than re-rendering the entire page.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in React is centered around components and state. You have to think of the elements on a webpage as individual, stand-alone pieces of the whole and how the information necessary for the webpage to work should be passed between each piece.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class components inherit from the the React.Component class, but functional components are defined as functions.
Class components are used to contain the state of an app. Functional components are used to create what the user will actually see and to manipulate state.

1.  Describe state.
State contains all of the data that an app needs. It is used to update components when it's data changes.

1.  Describe props.
Props are used to give data from state to the components. They are immutable and can only be changed if the state changes.
