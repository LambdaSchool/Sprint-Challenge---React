1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
React is Component based, which means code can be reused and/or populated over multiple areas. By utilizing state and props, content can be dynamically rendered over many different areas.

2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
Constructor - gets called whenever a new object is created.
componentDidMount - pulls everything in and loads it, signaling that everything has loaded properly
render - contains the content that will populate the pages/components(props)


3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class components allow us to set state and use lifestyle hooks. Functional components are just JavaScript functions.

4. Briefly describe PropTypes and what we use them for when building react applications.
