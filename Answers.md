1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    React is frontend libray that utilizes components to build user interfaces. 
    Functional components can be used to build static interfaces but the real power 
    of React is when components are built with classes.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Thinking in react means conceptualizing a user interface as components that can 
    be reused.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A functional component represents the bare JSX and props that renders the user interface component 
    while a class/stateful component can hold different states(changing the data) that is 
    represented.


4.  Describe state.
    State is way for a a component to dynamically represent data.
    
5.  Describe props.
    Props are properties of a component that can be passed into child components but that 
    are not writeable/changeable. State is for changing the data tied to a component.
