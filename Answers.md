1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is an UI library created by Facebook. React gives the developer a virtual DOM to render instead of the actual DOM. According to Mattias Johansson, "This allows you (at least in theory) to completely forget about DOM performance, and you can simply re-render the entire page all the time, as soon as your state changes. This almost always results in much smaller and simpler code base, which leads to less bugs.""
